            <p><b>Explanation of each row:-</b></p>

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Age</h4>
            <p>In this box, you have to enter your current age. Your age should be between 16 to 60 years to use this calculator. Any value less or more than this will generate an error.</p>
            
            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">How many number of months you trained already. If started enter 0.</h4>
            <p>In this box, you need to enter the total number of months you have been training so far. <b>If you are just beginning your workout journey, enter 0 for months.</b></p>
            
            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">In how many months you want to see results</h4>
            <p>In this box, you have to select the number of upcoming months in which you want to see your muscle gain results. You can select a value between 0 and 12 months.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Workout Quality (Training style you follow for upcoming selected months)</h4>
            
            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Low (Not Consistent)</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will not be consistent (around 3 days a week) during your target months for any reason, and your focus on workouts will be relatively low.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Medium (Consistent but not Focused)</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will be consistent (around 5 to 6 days a week) during your target months, but workout intensity and training each muscle till failure will be missing — in short, you won’t be giving 100% effort.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">High (Consistent plus Focused and Training till failure)</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will be highly consistent (around 6 days a week) during your target months with full intensity, training each muscle till complete failure — in short, giving your 100% effort in every workout.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Diet Quality (Diet you will maintain for upcoming entered months)</h4>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Poor (Low protein and calorie diet (≥0.5X and <1X gram protein))</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will be following a poor diet — low in protein (around ≥0.5 and &lt;1× your body weight in grams) and calories at or below maintenance level.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Average (Good protein and calorie diet (≥1X and <1.5X gram protein))</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will be following an average diet — moderate protein intake (around ≥1 and &lt;1.5× your body weight in grams) and calories at maintenance or slight surplus.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Good (High protein and calorie diet (>1.5X gram protein))</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you will be following a good diet — high in protein (more than 1.5× your body weight in grams) and calories in surplus, supporting faster muscle growth.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Genetics</h4>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Hard Gainer</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means your genetics make it harder for you to gain muscle or weight. You might struggle to put on size even when eating a lot. If you’re unsure, you can also consider your family genetics — if people in your family tend to stay lean despite eating more, this option likely fits you.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Average</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you have average genetics — you gain muscle and weight at a normal rate, neither too fast nor too slow.</p>

            <h5 style="color: #00b3ff;">Easy Gainer</h5>
            <p>If you select this option, it means you have good genetics and gain muscle easily. If increasing your diet quickly results in visible size gains or you naturally have a broad and slightly muscular build, you likely fall into this category.</p>

            <hr style="margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #555;">

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Enter Current Body Weight (in kg)</h4>
            <p>In this box, you have to enter your current body weight in kilograms (kg).</p>

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Enter Current Body Fat Percentage (%)</h4>
            <p>In this box, you have to enter your current body fat percentage (%). <b>If you don't know your body fat percentage, you can use the Body Fat Percentage (%) Calculator below the Muscle Gain Calculator.</b></p>

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">Enter Desired Body Fat (%) after target months</h4>
            <p>In this box, you have to enter your desired body fat percentage (%) which you aim to achieve in your selected target months.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #ffcc00;">What is Body Fat Percentage (%)</h4>
            <p>Body Fat Percentage (%) represents how much of your total body weight consists of fat. For example, if a person weighs 70 kg and has 15% body fat, that means about 10.5 kg of their weight is fat, and 59.5 kg is lean mass (muscle, bones, organs, etc.). It’s an important metric to understand how much of your body weight is healthy muscle versus stored fat.</p>
